NAME
  hpm - the Hel Repository package manager

SYNOPSIS
  hpm COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
  Command-line package manager for OpenOS (OpenComputers). Allows to easily download and install programs from the Hel Repository and OpenPrograms repositories.
  You can define your own way of package distribution using custom hpm modules.

  Available commands:
  install <package> [...]   Download package[s] and their dependencies from the Hel Repository, and install it to the system.
  remove <package> [...]    Remove package[s] and their dependants from the system.
  list                      Show list of installed packages.
  help                      Show help message.

OPTIONS
  -q
    Quiet mode - no console output.
  -v
    Verbose mode - show additional info.
 --c, --config
      Path to hpm config file.
  -y
    Don't ask to press the Enter key for confirmation.

METHOD-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
  install, oppm:install
    -r, --reinstall
      Reinstall the package: remove it first, and then install.
      If you specify the version of package to install (like, `hpm install package@1.1.0`), the package can be upgraded and downgraded.
      Be careful, though! Dependencies are not resolved. The depsolver will be added in future updated.

    -l, --local
      Install the package using the `manifest` file in the directory given instead of package name.

    -s, --save
      Place the package in a directory in PWD instead of installing it globally.

MANIFEST
  For easier package management you can create the file called `manifest` (usually you want to create it in the root directory of project). The following is the manifest template.

{name="pkg-name",
 version="1.0.2-dev",
 dependencies={
  {name="dep-name", version="^1.5.2", type="required"},
  ...
 },
 files={
  {url="docs/program", dir="/usr/man", name="program"},
  ...
 }}

  dependencies

    - `name` is dependency name.
    - `version` is dependency version requirement string.
    - `type` is currently unused but kept for future updates. Should be `required`.

  files
    The list of files of the package.
    - `url` is the path *relative to the manifest file*.
